## 🚀 DELIVERABLE 1: AI-READY APP GENERATION PROMPTS 
These prompts can be used with AI app builders, code-gen tools, or autonomous agents.

### 🔹 Master System Prompt (Root Prompt)
You are building a Church Management Web Application for a local Assemblies of God – Ghana church.
The system must manage people, departments, events, finances, donations, projects, missions, services, and yearly plans, using role-based access control.
The app must support:
- Pastors & Church Leaders
- Department Heads
- Treasurers / Finance Officers
- Members & New Converts
- Volunteers

Priorities:
- Transparency
- Accountability
- Simplicity
- Scalability
- Ghana-specific finance flows (e.g., MTN MoMo)

Build the system in modular architecture, where each major feature is an independent module that can be enabled or disabled.
